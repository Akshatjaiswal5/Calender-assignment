# Calender-assignment

I have completed the given assignment as much I can in 48 hrs.\
-> I have not used 'any' third party libraries, all the code is pure react, markup, css and js.\
-> I have used 'formik' for form used in adding appointment.\
-> I have used context api and a separate custom component to manage states.\
-> I have used useReducer, useContext hooks.\
Things I could have done better:\
->Css styling can massively improved, the current css "just works" but with more time, it could be refactored to be more streamlined.\
-> in hindsight, the 'currWeekArr' must not be in context but rather be a component's state.\
-> If I had more time, I could implement a month view, additional details etc\

I have spent a lot of time on this, Hope you like it.
